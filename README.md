A simple Java game made for school. Checked in to teach my daugther how to use github. 
The game creates a number of robins. Estimate how many robins you can see on the screen.  

The Code runs in BlueJ and needs the JGUIToolbox library (http://ovtg-alt.ovtg.de/3_arbeit/informatik/JGUIWeb/JGUIStart.html) made for teaching purposes.
